# Instructions
# ============
#
# The easiest will generally be to delete the lines that follow these instructions
# and to use the form underneath to add your own events. On occasion, though, it may
# make sense to manually add events to the list. Here's how.
#
# First off, note that these lines and the section headers beneath are ignored: Lines
# that begin with an asterisk (*) or a pound (#) character are treated as comments.
#
# The general syntax to insert an event is:
# 
#   [Date] [Event Name]
#
# The event name can include arbitrary HTML. Event dates can have various formats:
#
# - YYYY-MM-DD
#
#   The event occurs on that date.
#
# - MM-DD
#
#   The event occurs on that date, each year.
#
# - nth weekday month
#
#   The event occurs the nth weekday of that month.
#
#   nth, weekday, and month respectively are either of:
#   - 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, last
#   - sun, mon, tue, wed, thu, fri, sat
#   - jan, feb, mar, apr, may, jun, jul, aug, sep, oct, nov, dec, all
#   
# - YYYY-MM-DD through YYYY-MM-DD
#
#   The event occurs from the first date to the last.
#
# - every week starting YYYY-MM-DD
#   every nth week starting YYYY-MM-DD
#
#   The event occurs every so many weeks starting that date.
#
#   nth is either of:
#   - other, 2nd, 3rd, 4th
# 
# - every week starting YYYY-MM-DD until YYYY-MM-DD
#   every nth week starting YYYY-MM-DD until YYYY-MM-DD
#
#   The event occurs every so many weeks between those dates.
#
# - Each of the available date formats can optionally be offset, in one of two ways:
#
#   - n days|weeks|years before|after
#   - the weekday before|after
#
# Many examples follow. Keep or delete them, and start adding yours.
